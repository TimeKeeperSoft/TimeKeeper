## What is TimeKeeper?

TimeKeeper is the simplest cross-platform PC time-tracking program. It periodically reminds users to take breaks while working on their computers. It's free of unnecessary web and AI features.

## Idea

Many people do not take breaks when working at a PC. As a result, the efficiency of such work decreases due to fatigue, musculoskeletal problems due to sedentary lifestyle and all kinds of eye disorders. Consequently, users need a simple program that, adjusting to their rhythm of work, could remind them of the need to take a break from work.

The program is intended for use by people who are exposed to high visual loads and/or lead sedentary lifestyles.

**Star this repo if you've ever:**

- Missed lunch because of `cargo build --release`
- Had wrist pain from too much coding
- Needed a non-annoying reminder

## Motivation

1. I needed a cross-platform timekeeping program. Such a program should be simple, lightweight and quite functional.
2. Many people forget to take breaks while working on the computer, which is detrimental to their productivity and health. Take a break - stretch, get some fresh air and continue working. This will slow down the damage to your health.
3. I needed to practice developing desktop software in Rust. TimeKeeper is the second project, the first one was [ice](https://github.com/mskrasnov/ice).

### Why Rust + Iced?

1. 0.1% CPU usage
2. Fast and reliable software work
3. It's fun ;)

## Benefits

1. **Offline.** TimeKeeper does not require a browser or Internet access to work.
2. **Cross-platform.** Our program works correctly in Windows and Linux operating systems and does not depend on most external libraries like Qt and GTK (and even the god-awful Electron).
3. **Minimalistic.** TimeKeeper occupies no more than 20 MB on the hard disk and is able to work even on weak PCs.
4. **Statistics.** TimeKeeper is able to keep local statistics of work/rest cycles so that the user has an idea of how much they are working and how often they need to take breaks.
5. **Notifications.** Regardless of the OS on which TimeKeeper is running, you will receive notifications on your desktop when your work/rest cycle starts/ends.

## Installation

### Already compiled program

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/mskrasnov/TimeKeeper) tab and download the latest *stable* release for your operating system. Currently only Windows (x86_64) and Linux (glibc x86_64) are supported.

### Build from source code

**Dependencies:**

- Rust toolchain (can be installed with `rustup`);
- **Windows:** MSVC;
- **Linux:** `binutils`, `gcc`, Xorg/Wayland

**Building in Windows:**

```ps
cargo build --release
.\target\release\time_keeper
```

> **Note:** if you want to build `*.msi` installer for Windows, you should install WiX and [`cargo-wix`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-wix) programs and execute this:

```ps
cargo wix --nocapture --output target/time_keeper.msi
```

The built installer will be located in the `target/time_keeper.msi` file.

**Building in Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential -y

cargo build --release
./target/release/time_keeper
```

## Technology stack
