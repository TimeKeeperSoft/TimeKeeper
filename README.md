## What is TimeKeeper?

TimeKeeper is the simplest cross-platform program for PC time tracking. It is used to periodically remind the user of the need to take breaks while working on a PC.

> **Warning:** not TimeKeeper only in Russian. I will add new translations (English for example) to version 1.0.0.

## Idea

Many people do not take breaks when working at a PC. As a result, the efficiency of such work decreases due to fatigue, musculoskeletal problems due to sedentary lifestyle and all kinds of eye disorders. Consequently, users need a simple program that, adjusting to their rhythm of work, could remind them of the need to take a break from work.

The program is intended for use by people who are exposed to high visual loads and/or lead sedentary lifestyles.

## Motivation

1. I needed a cross-platform timekeeping program. Such a program should be simple, lightweight and quite functional.
2. Many people forget to take breaks while working on the computer, which is detrimental to their productivity and health. Take a break - stretch, get some fresh air and continue working. This will slow down the damage to your health.
3. I needed to practice developing desktop software in Rust. TimeKeeper is the second project, the first one was [ice](https://github.com/mskrasnov/ice).

## Benefits

1. **Offline.** TimeKeeper does not require a browser or Internet access to work.
2. **Cross-platform.** Our program works correctly in Windows and Linux operating systems and does not depend on most external libraries like Qt and GTK (and even the god-awful Electron).
3. **Minimalistic.** TimeKeeper occupies no more than 20 MB on the hard disk and is able to work even on weak PCs.
4. [TODO] **Statistics.** TimeKeeper is able to keep local statistics of work/rest cycles so that the user has an idea of how much they are working and how often they need to take breaks.
5. **Notifications.** Regardless of the OS on which TimeKeeper is running, you will receive notifications on your desktop when your work/rest cycle starts/ends.
